--Readme document for Vedaant Patel--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

The basic features I included in my website are:
- Including an image with descriptive alt text
    These images include the logo, iphone mockups, and a personal photo.

- Appropriate headings and paragraphs
    The headers give a brief overview of what the paragraphs will be describing.

- Links to external pages
    There are links to linkedin and my personal portfolio through the about page.

- Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them
    Created multiple pages hosting different types of information.

- Semantic HTML tags like aside or footer   
    Created a footer to hold copywrite info.

(b) CSS features

- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
    Modified padding and margins to make the webpage responsive.

- Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the Resources section.
    Modified the text colors and background colors to make it more appealing.

- Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers such as image shapes and table layouts to display content in a more interesting manner
    Used bootstrap css classes to help create div tags that are responsive.

(c) Advanced features

- Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
    Created a sticky nav bar that stays at the top of the screen. This nav bar has buttons that redirects user to different pages.

- A contact form which leverages HTML forms
    Created a contact form which leverages the npm package @emailjs/browser to allow users to contact me via email through the website.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

    This assignment took me about 12-15 hours to complete.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

    Some online resources I used to help in the making were:
        - ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/): Used ChatGPT to understand the structure of css and how it affects my divs and elements.
        - Termly.io (https://termly.io/): This was used to generate the privacy policy for my app. It gives me HTML code for the privacy policy after inputting details about the data privacy within the app.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

    I did not consult with any classmates or other individuals for this assignment.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

    To run this code please run:

    npm install @emailjs/browser

    This is necessary to be able to use the contact form in the contact.html. Without this, emails will not be able to be sent to me.
    
    Something to be noted is, the html code for privacy-policy.html was not created by me. Instead the code was created by Termly (link is given above).
    The only part of the code that was created by me in privacy-policy.html was the navbar.
